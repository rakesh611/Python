# 🔁 Python Loops for DevOps

## 📌 What is a loop in Python?

In DevOps, loops are used to **automate repetitive operational tasks** such as:

* Server health checks
* CI/CD deployments
* Monitoring logs
* Cloud resource validation
* Kubernetes & Docker automation

---

## 1️⃣ `for` Loop – Iterate Over Servers


servers = ["web01", "web02", "db01", "k8s-master"]

for server in servers:
    print(f"Checking status of {server}")


**Use case:** SSH checks, patching, monitoring

---

## 2️⃣ Loop Over Environments (CI/CD)


environments = ["dev", "qa", "uat", "prod"]

for env in environments:
    print(f"Deploying application to {env}")


**Use case:** Pipeline stages

---

## 3️⃣ `while` Loop – Wait Until Condition is Met


service_status = "DOWN"

while service_status != "UP":
    print("Service is down... retrying")
    service_status = "UP"


**Use case:** Pod / service readiness checks

---

## 4️⃣ Loop with `range()` – Retry Mechanism


for attempt in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Attempt {attempt}: Calling API")


**Use case:** Cloud API retries

---

## 5️⃣ Loop with Condition – Disk Monitoring


disk_usage = [45, 67, 82, 90]

for usage in disk_usage:
    if usage > 80:
        print(f"ALERT: Disk usage high -> {usage}%")


**Use case:** Monitoring & alerting

---

## 6️⃣ Loop Over Dictionary – Inventory Management


servers = {
    "web01": "nginx",
    "db01": "mysql",
    "ci01": "jenkins"
}

for server, role in servers.items():
    print(f"{server} is running {role}")


**Use case:** Ansible-like inventory

---

## 7️⃣ Nested Loop – Multi-Env Deployment


environments = ["dev", "prod"]
services = ["frontend", "backend", "database"]

for env in environments:
    for service in services:
        print(f"Deploying {service} to {env}")


**Use case:** Microservices deployment

---

## 8️⃣ Loop with `break` – Stop on Failure


steps = ["build", "test", "deploy"]

for step in steps:
    print(f"Running {step}")
    if step == "test":
        print("Test failed! Stopping pipeline")
        break


**Use case:** CI/CD failure handling

---

## 9️⃣ Loop with `continue` – Skip Unhealthy Server


servers = ["web01", "web02", "db01"]

for server in servers:
    if server == "web02":
        print(f"{server} unreachable, skipping")
        continue
    print(f"Connecting to {server}")


**Use case:** Partial infra failures

---

## 🔟 Log Scanning Using Loop

logs = [
    "INFO Service started",
    "INFO Health check OK",
    "ERROR Database connection failed",
    "INFO Retry successful"
]

for line in logs:
    if "ERROR" in line:
        print(f"ALERT FOUND -> {line}")

**Use case:** Log monitoring

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Infinite Loop – Continuous Monitoring

import time

while True:
    print("Checking system health...")
    time.sleep(5)

**Use case:** Daemon-style monitoring scripts

---



## ✅ Summary

| Loop Type | DevOps Usage     |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| for       | Server iteration |
| while     | Health checks    |
| nested    | Multi-env deploy |
| break     | Fail-fast        |
| continue  | Skip failures    |
