✅ 1️⃣ What is a While Loop?
A while loop runs as long as a condition is True.
🔹 Syntax
while condition:
    # code block
👉 It keeps running until the condition becomes False.

✅ 2️⃣ Basic Example
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
🔥 Output:
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
⚠️ Important: Infinite Loop
If you don’t update the condition, it will run forever.
while True:
    print("Running...")
👉 This is called an infinite loop.
Used in:
Monitoring scripts
Log watchers
Background services
Stop it using Ctrl + C.

✅ 3️⃣ While Loop with User Input
password = ""
while password != "admin123":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access Granted")
👉 Keeps asking until correct password entered.


✅ 4️⃣ While Loop with Break
break stops the loop immediately.
count = 1
while True:
    print(count)
    if count == 5:
        break
    count += 1

✅ 5️⃣ While Loop with Continue
continue skips current iteration.
count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        continue
    print(count)
👉 Output:
1
2
4
5

✅ 6️⃣ DevOps Practical Example – Server Monitoring
import time
cpu_usage = 50
while cpu_usage < 80:
    print("CPU Normal:", cpu_usage)
    cpu_usage += 10
    time.sleep(1)
print("CPU Critical!")

✅ 7️⃣ Real DevOps Example – Wait for Service
import time
service_status = "starting"
while service_status != "running":
    print("Waiting for service...")
    time.sleep(2)
    service_status = "running"
print("Service is running!")
